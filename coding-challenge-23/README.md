# Coding Challenge 23

1. Recreate the previous challenge, but this time using **ES6** classes: create an `EVCl` child class of the `CarCl` class.
2. Make the `charge` property private.
3. Implement the ability to chain the `accelerate()` and `chargeBattery()` methods of this class, and also update the `brake()` method in the Car class. Then experiment with chaining.

**DATA CAR 1:** 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%.
