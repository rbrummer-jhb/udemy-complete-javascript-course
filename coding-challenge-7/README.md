# Coding Challenge 7

Let's go back to Mark & John comparing their BMIs!  
This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations!  
**Remember**: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height).  
*(mass in kg & height in meter)*

1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass,  
and height *(Mark Miller & John Smith)*
2. Create a `calcBMI()` method on each object to calculate the BMI *(the same method on both objects)*.  
Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI.  
**Example**: *"John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's BMI (23.9)!"*

**TEST DATA**:  
Mark weighs **78kg** and is **1.69m** tall.  
John weighs **92kg** and is **1.95m** tall.
